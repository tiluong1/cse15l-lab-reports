Part 3:
In the week 2 and 3 lab, I learned how to create a webserver, whcih allows different methods that can be implemented into it. For example, you can add a message into the server and it would automatically run the method. Furthermore, I was not fully aware of hwo URl works, but fromt the labs I have a better understanding how URL works and that you cann methods into them.
